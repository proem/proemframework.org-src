  <h3>About Proem</h3>
  <p>
    The Proem framework aims to be a lightweight, simple &amp; fast MVC implementation built on top of PHP5.4
  </p>
  <p>
    The overall design has been kicking around my head for a number of years, slowly becoming more
    and more refined over time. This is actually the third iteration of the idea.
  </p>
  <p>
    The current idea sees the framework become Event driven, with the Bootstrap process executing a filter chain to
    instantiate the bulk of the components required to build an application. During the execution of each step in the
    filter chain, events are triggered exposing the ability to customise this process.
    </p>
  <p>
    The project currently consists of this website, <a href="http://proemframework.org">http://proemframework.org</a>, an irc channel on #proem
    irc.freenode.net, and our issue tracker and code repositories on <a href="https://github.com/proem/proem/issues">GitHub</a>.

  <h3>About the documentation</h3>
  <p>
    Please be aware that while this documentation is accurate at the time of writing, Proem is a fast moving target at this point in time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Complete and absolute name space paths are used throughout the Proem documentation for clarity. In the real world, you would use
    shorter aliased names.
  </p>
  <p>
    Proem is still very much in early pre-alpha stages and should be considered under <strong>heavy development</strong>. While writing this documentation I have made a best effort to ensure that
    all code examples are tested. However, there are parts of the documentation where features that are not currently available are made mention of. Where this occurs, it
    is also mentioned that these features are "planned" or "soon to be worked on". In some cases issues are also linked to within the <a href="https://github.com/proem/proem/issues">Issue Tracker</a>

  <h3>How to make use of this documentation</h3>
  <p>
    The menu on the left follows a path that means reading each of the pages linked to from top to bottom should progress through the frameworks functionality in a reasonably linear fashion. The menu
    has been split into three distinct sections:
  </p>
  <h5>An Overview</h5>
  <p>
    This section contains guides designed to give you a high level view of how things work, as well as detailed information about the Bootstrap process.
  </p>
  <p>
    {{ docLink('installation') }} is a fairly obvious first step, the {{ docLink('quickstart') }} then guides you through building a <b>very</b>
    simple application without going into too much detail before {{ docLink('bootstrap') }} walks you through a first introduction to the Proem internals and how
    the framework is held together.
  </p>
  <h5>The Components</h5>
  <p>
    In this section each of the components within the framework are described in further detail. These pages could likely be looked at more as a reference than a guide but reading these will give you a
    thorough understanding of the framework and how to make the most of the functionality it provides.
  </p>
  <h5>Userland Code</h5>
  <p>
    The <em>Userland</em> section covers how you can write code to extend and build upon the Proem framework.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are then still looking for more detail we also have available the {{ apiLink('Proem', 'API Documentation') }}. This documentation documents every class and method
    within Proem and is automatically generated from comments within the actual code itself.
  </p>
