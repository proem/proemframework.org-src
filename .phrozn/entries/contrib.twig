  <p>
    The Proem framework is currently in the very early stages of development and as such is still in what would be
    considered very much a pre-alpha stage. The framework will be considered such all the way through the 0.x.x milestones.
  </p>
  <p>
    This fact alone should create great incentive for people who want to get in on the ground floor and help out with a modern
    MVC framework that utilises some of the newest features of PHP.

    Just be aware before contributing, that we have a few simple guidelines.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="well">
  <h3>Developer guidelines</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>All pull requests should have a related issue in the issue tracker.</li>
    <li>All pull requests should be made within a self contained branch created specifically for this feature.</li>
    <li>All code should have accompanying and passing unit tests.</li>
    <li>All code should be formatted and commented in a way that is consistent with the existing code base.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    At this early stage I'm not going to get into the nitty gritty of <em>coding standards</em> and proposal guidelines.
    Just keep things consistent and similar to what already exists.
  <p>
  <p>
    Be aware that not all pull requests will be excepted as is. Some will provoke discussion. They will however, all be looked at.

  <h3>Git branching model</h3>
  <p>
    Currently we employ the Git branching model described by Vincent Driessen in his excellent blog post <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a condensed version of this guide in the root of the repo (GITHOWTO.md).
