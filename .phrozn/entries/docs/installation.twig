  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>
    There are a few different ways to install Proem for use. The first and easiest is to simply download the phar archive and include
    it where you need it, the second is to download the source and place the lib directory onto your include_path.
  <p>
  <p>
    Which one you choose really depends on what your going to do with Proem.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="well">
  <h3>Dependencies</h3>
  <p>
    Proem was developed from the ground up to take advantage of some of the newer features that are only available in PHP5.4. As such
    it requires PHP5.4 to run.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other than the PHP5.4 dependency there are currently no other hard requirements to use Proem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having said that however, if you plan on contributing to the Proem project, plan on installing Proem from source or plan on executing
    Proem's test suite we recommend you have <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> installed as well as the <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer">Composer</a>
    package manager for PHP.
  </p>

  <h3>Enable rewrite rules</h3>
  <p>
    In order for all the necessary requests to your server to be processed by Proem you need to rewrite these requests to your bootstrap.php file.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache HHTP Server</a> you can do this by defining a simple rewrite rule.
  </p>
  <pre>
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule !\.(js|ico|gif|jpg|png|css)$ /index.php
  </pre>
</div>
<div class="well">
  <h3>Using the phar archive</h3>
  <p>
    The phar archive route is by far the easiest to get up and running with. Simply <a href="http://proemframework.org/downloads/proem.phar">download</a>
    the latest phar archive and include it into your bootstrap.php file for use.
  <pre class="prettyprint">
    include 'phar://proem.phar';

    (new \Proem\Proem)->init();
  </pre>
  <p>
    The phar archive takes care of adding Proem to the Autoloader so everything is just ready to go.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="well">
  <h3>Installing the source</h3>
  <p>
    You can get Proem's source by either downloading the latest package from <a href="https://github.com/proem/proem/downloads">here</a> or by cloning
    the repository using git.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>git clone git://github.com/proem/proem.git</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have the source code, to make use of it, all you need do is put the lib directory on your include_path.
  </p>
  <p>
    Edit your php.ini file to read similar to:
  </p>
  <pre>
    include_path = ".:/usr/share/php:/path/to/proem/lib"
  </pre>
  <p>
    Even though Proem is now on your include path you still need to manually add the name space to the Autoloader within your bootstrap.php file.
  </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
    require_once 'Proem/Autoloader.php';

    (new \Proem\AutoLoader)
      ->registerNamespace('Proem', '/path/to/proem/lib')
      ->register();
  </pre>
  <p>
    More information on can be found in the <a href="/docs/autoloader.html">Autoloader</a> docs.
